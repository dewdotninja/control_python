## Project Description
<p />The contents in this repository are converted from my 
<a href="https://scilabdotninja.wordpress.com/" target=_blank>Scilab.ninja</a> website. 
They are mostly Jupyter notebooks with Python code, using Scipy and Python Control Systems 
libraries. The emphasis is on control system analysis and design, and robotics. The materials could serve as classroom teaching aids in engineering schools where the subjects are offered.

## Installation

<b>Requirement : </b> Python 3 with Scipy & Python control systems

<p />The notebooks can be executed on Google colab or on your local computer. 

<p />Execute the commands below to install Python control systems library in Colab
<pre>
!pip install slycot
!pip install control
</pre>

<p />I use Anaconda to setup a Jupyter notebook environment. The process is quite detailed.
Please consult some online information. 
<p />Suppose the environment name is <em>controlenv</em>. Python Control System can be installed by 
typing
<pre>
conda install -c conda-forge -n controlenv control
</pre>
<p />at the command prompt
